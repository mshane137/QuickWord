Here we have QuickWord, a fun and simple game to help build and practice vocabulary. Upon starting the app you will see a sign in page that will track user data. Once you sign in you will see the menu screen, and from here you have some options as to what you can do.
You can select from the menu
Start game- which begins the game cycle 
records- which contains data about your high score and your highest streak
settings- which allows you to enable hardcore mode or study mode
audio- which allows you to control in game audio
credits- which contains the names of the people who made this wonderful game
info- and lastly the info button gives you info on how the game works and how to play it.

Upon pressing start game you will be thrown into the game which will do a coin toss to determine if you get one of two gamemodes; spelling or matching
spelling will give the player a definition to which the player will respond by spelling out the word being defined using the boxes with letters
matching will give the player 6 boxes in a random order and the player must figure out which boxes pair together to make 3 sets of either synonyms or antonyms.
upon completion of a round you will earn points and then another coin toss will happen to randomly generate the next gamemode and this will continue on until the player either 
loses all hearts, the player will start with 3 hearts and every mistake made throughout the 2 gamemodes will take one away or until the player
runs out of time, there will be a timer counting down in the background and whenever it runs out GAME OVER!
whenever the player gets a game over the high score and streak will transfer to your records if you broke any of them

to expand upod study mode and hardmode
study mode is where  you can enter your own custom data and use it to play the game in case you need to study 
hardmode is where you get only 1 heart as to up the challenge a bit if you feel confident enough
